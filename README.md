# comparator
#### A simple dual comparator in Eurorack format.
  
Inputs between +12V and -12V can be compared, and an output of 0 or 5V will be produced accordingly, indicated by the LED.
  
The voltage to compare input A against is controlled by the knob, and is be default 0-12V. However, this voltage can be replaced by plugging a jack into input B, in which case the knob will attenuate this input.
